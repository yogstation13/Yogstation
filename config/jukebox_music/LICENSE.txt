---LICENSE NOTICE---

The server operator(s) is responsible for the copyright status of all sounds placed within the /config/jukebox_music folder unless otherwise noted.

If a sound requires attribution and/or a specific license it is up to the operator(s) to make this information publicly available on either 
a website associated with their server or on the server itself. 

If operators(s) allow these configuration files to be public this file can serve that purpose by keeping it properly updated.

If in the future new sounds are published to these folders (i.e. in an online code repository) they must explicitly state their 
license if said license is not the same as the default licensing found in README.md in the root directory of the project.

Do not remove this notice.
